Additionally, its vast territorial expansion created severe administrative challenges, making it susceptible to both internal revolts and external invasions. Coupled with these, shifts in societal values due to the rise of Christianity altered the Roman population’s focus and loyalty, all forming the primary factors that led to the decline.</answer>"
